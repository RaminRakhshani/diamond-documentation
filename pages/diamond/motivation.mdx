# Motivation
There are a number of different reasons to use diamonds. Here are some of them:

1. **A single address for unlimited contract functionality.** Using a single address for contract functionality makes deployment, testing and integration with other smart contracts, software and user interfaces easier.
2. **Your contract exceeds the 24KB maximum contract size.** You may have related functionality that it makes sense to keep in a single contract, or at a single contract address. A diamond does not have a max contract size.
3. **A diamond provides a way to organize contract code and data.** You may want to build a contract system with a lot of functionality. A diamond provides a systematic way to isolate different functionality and connect them together and share data between them as needed in a gas-efficient way.
4. **A diamond provides a way to upgrade functionality.** Upgradeable diamonds can be upgraded to add/replace/remove functionality. Because diamonds have no max contract size, there is no limit to the amount of functionality that can be added to diamonds over time. Diamonds can be upgradeable or immutable. It is also possible to make an upgradeable diamond and then at a later time remove its upgrade capability.
